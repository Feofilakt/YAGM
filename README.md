# YAGM

This is YAGM - Yet another governors mod for Civilization 6. The main goal is to make all the governors and their promotions desired, convenient to use and not frustrating. Not just Pingala as for now.

## Changes

- Many promotions changed, some effects added and some removed. See screens, check descriptions in xml or right in the game.
- Each governor has one more promotion (6 total instead of 5)
- Casa de Contrataci√≥n nerfed (2 extra promotion points instead of 3) to compensate their enlarged power
- The Enlightenment and Mercantilism civics give promotion points to compensate the increased total number of promotions

## Balance

Sometimes governor bonuses can stack with other game bonuses and become too strong in concrete circumstances. It is ok, but if you think that something need nerf, please write (with an arguments).

I tried to make all promotion effects strong, but it is hard to maintanance balance. If you think that some promotion not strong enougth, please also write.

## Evolution

I think that mod is ready to be share with other players and may be useful, but is doesnot mean it is ideal and perfect. Probably there will be changes, both gameplay and technical. If you want to discuss something or make a suggestion, welcome.

## Non-goals:
- Mod does not and will not be changing the main specialisations of the governors. Pingala for science and culture, Moksha for faith and religion, Reyna for money and so on. They seem completely ok to me.
- Mod is not oriented for network game speed. It can be used on any speed of cause, but balance considered for standard speed in the first place. For example, if some promotion on network speed is more important than on standard speed, there is nothing I can do about it.

## Languages

- [x] english _(not corrected)_
- [x] russian

## TODO:

- [ ] create Ibraghim's last promotion
- [ ] right promotion connections in UI
- [ ] test Victor's balance

## Technical details

_Skip this until a problem appears._

Mod works for latest civ release. Old releases are not supported.

Source code is a mess and probably will never be refactored.

Mod was in alpha version and tested just by me and my friend. Now I have changed it to Beta. You may be facing bugs. In such case write about it, preferably in detail.

I dont know of any compatibility issues. Should work with other mods (except those that change governorts, of cause).

I obviously am not native. If you want to improve english descriptions or other texts, PR are welcome.
